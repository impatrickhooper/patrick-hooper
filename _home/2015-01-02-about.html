  <h3 class="motto">I love to solve problems. Preferrably using technology, but I'm not picky.</h3>
  <p class="grid-50 tablet-grid-50 mobile-grid-100">Ever since I was a little kid in the great midwestern state of Michigan, I've had an affinity for keeping things clean. But in a totally awesome way. Seriously - I used to walk around with a broom and dustpan making sure everything was up to snuff. Okay...what does this have to do with anything? Well, it's a good way to shed some light on how I approach a lot of things in my life. I like when things are neat and streamlined. I place a <strong><em>strong emphasis</em></strong> on quality over quantity. </p>

  <p class="grid-50 tablet-grid-50 mobile-grid-100">So I got myself a shiny degree from the University of Michigan in Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering to really help me learn about efficiency, paired it with a love of web design and development, and never looked back. I think optimization + (web) technology is #sexy. Paperless, automated processes are stunning. Clean, simple designs are gorgeous. Concise, effective code is beautiful. And all of those things together? To me, that's art.</p>
