  <section class="project-overview">
  <h3 class="subtitle">{ OVERVIEW }</h3>

  <p class="project-description">In 2012, the University of Michigan moved from Exchange to Google Apps. I was fortunate to be part of the team that orchestrated an explosion of online, automated processes within Athletics.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">{ GIFT PROCESSING FORM }</h3>

    <p>The Development division had a form built in Microsoft Access for processing donations (actual payments were processed separately). This had a lot of drawbacks. For example, since this was a file on a network server, only one person could use open and write to it at once, even though many people needed to process gifts simultaneously. So we recreated the form online in Google Apps Script and had it write to a Google Sheet, allowing for a more collaborative workflow.</p>

  <section class="project-section grid-50 tablet-grid-100 mobile-grid-100">
    <h3 class="subtitle">{ STUDENT ATHLETES XML }</h3>

    <p>The Marketing division had access to full XML rosters (coaches and players) for each sport at the University of Michigan. For their website, MGOBLUE.com, they frequently needed to filter these lists down to just active players with a specific subset of information for their biographies on the site. Using a Google Apps Script and its ability to fetch and parse URLs as XML, I helped them accomplish this in an automated fashion rather than having to do it by hand. The script ran once and day and generated a customized XML file in a folder accessible by them in Google Drive.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">{ INVENTORY TRACKER }</h3>

    <p>Throughout the year, Development would hold auctions for various sports and gear. They had a large inventory list of these items, but no great way, other than tediously tracking them manually, to keep up with information like what was sold, quantity, profit, when, and where. We used Google Sheets to automate this process for them. In this spreadsheet, there was a master list of items and associated information like quantity and cost. Then, each auction got its own sheet, and when an item was sold, the master list automatically updated to reflect changes to things like running totals of quantity and profit. Reports could also be run to show a summary of auctions, what items were sold, and the totals. This was accomplished by using data in the Google Sheet to feed a Google Doc template.</p>

  <section class="project-section grid-50 tablet-grid-100 mobile-grid-100">
    <h3 class="subtitle">{ SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS }</h3>

    <p>The Development division was responsible for organizing events that people from Athletics would speak at. As you can imagine, trying to track the schedules and events of all these people was a nightmare. So, we used Google Sheets to help them sleep easier. A master list of events was used to track each event throughout the year. In this sheet, there was a field for speakers. Each of these speakers also got their own sheet, so when their name was entered for an event, it automatically appeared on their list of events. Various reports, like a list of speakers by event or vice versa, could be generated by funneling data from the Google Sheet to a Google Doc template. </p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">{ WRESTLING EVALUATIONS }</h3>

    <p>At the end of the season, Wrestling put together a evaluation form in Google Forms. Student athletes then filled out this form, which populated a Google Sheet. When the coaches and managers wanted to review these evaluations, they were stuck with a spreadsheet of data and sought a better way. We helped them use this data to populate a Google Doc template, and then saved it as a PDF to generate a more user-friendly report for each student.</p>

    <h3 class="subtitle">{ GPA CALCULATOR }</h3>

    <p>In order to help make the lives of student athletes easier, we built a GPA calculator for them in Google Apps Script. Sure, there are a lot of these out there, but this was was customized for the Athletics department (maize and blue!) and kept alongside a lot of other valuable resources so everything was in one place.</p>
