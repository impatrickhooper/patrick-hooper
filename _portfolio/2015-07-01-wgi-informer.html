description: Wantman Group, Inc. (WGI) had a dated intranet running on a difficult-to-use Drupal setup with a nightmare for a codebase. They gave me the opportunity to build them a new one, so I gave them a clean, user-friendly site with more bells and whistles than they could have imagined!

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ HOME }</h3>
        <p>The home page provides highlights of the most important information from around the intranet and within the company. This means a hero slider for big announcements, event cards (when there are some upcoming), introductions to new employees, employee birthdays and work anniversaries, news cards, and some photos albums from recent events.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ NAVIGATION }</h3>
        <p>There are a few flavors of navigation that can be found on the intranet. The first is the slide-in side navigation accessed via the hamburger/menu icon. Next are the Favorites, accessed via the star icon immediately next to the hamburger. The Spotlight section contains some fun, random snippets of info and is opened as a bottom modal using the lightbulb icon. Finally, the floating button opens various Typeforms.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ PHOTOS }</h3>
        <p>Photos from company events are stored in Picasa and linked to from this page. Each album gets a thumbnail photo and name that links out to the respective Picasa page. These are presented to users in a simple, clean thumbnail grid.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ DIVISIONS }</h3>
        <p>Division pages are resource repositories for each division within the company. Each one has a customized photo header and links to helpful resources. The landing page gives you a glimpse of some of the popular links, and if you're looking to dig deeper into the vault, you can click through the the full division page.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ DIRECTORY }</h3>
        <p>The directory is a (dangerously addictive) way to put a face to a name within the company. It also provides the basic contact information that accompanies said face. Why so addictive? The picture and contact information are presented on a rotating card; picture on the front, contact on the back. When you hover or touch, the card twirls. For rows and rows of people, things can get out of hand quickly...in the best possible way.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ TRAINING }</h3>
        <p>The training section contains a pretty awesome interactive manual built using Turn.js. It allows users to read all about different features and uses of the intranet, all within the comfort of their browser. With animated page turning, keyboard navigation, a table of contents, and lots of images, it's a very easy-to-use and rewarding resource.</p>
