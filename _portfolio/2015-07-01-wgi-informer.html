description: Wantman Group, Inc. (WGI) had a dated intranet running on a difficult-to-use Drupal setup with a nightmare for a codebase. They gave me the opportunity to build them a new one, so I gave them a clean, user-friendly site with more bells and whistles than they could have imagined!

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ HOME }</h3>
        <p>The home page provides highlights of the most important information from around the intranet and within the company. This means icons for commonly used links, a hero slider for strongly emphasized events or news, accordions for employee happenings (birthdays and anniversaries), sliders for news/events, and a (collapsible) sidebar for less important but still fun tidbits.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ EVENTS }</h3>
        <p>The events and news pages are blog-style lists of teasers and thumbnail photos. They give you a glimpse of what each article is about, and if you're interested you can click through to a specific one for more information.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ PHOTOS }</h3>
        <p>Photos from company events are stored in Picasa and linked to from this page. Each album gets a thumbnail photo and name that links out to the respective Picasa page. These are presented to users in a simple, clean thumbnail grid.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ DIVISIONS }</h3>
        <p>Division pages are resource repositories for each division within the company. Each one has a customized photo header and links to helpful resources. The landing page gives you a glimpse of some of the popular links, and if you're looking to dig deeper into the vault, you can click through the the full division page.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ DIRECTORY }</h3>
        <p>The directory is a (dangerously addictive) way to put a face to a name within the company. It also provides the basic contact information that accompanies said face. Why so addictive? The picture and contact information are presented on a rotating card; picture on the front, contact on the back. When you hover or touch, the card twirls. For rows and rows of people, things can get out of hand quickly...in the best possible way.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ TRAINING }</h3>
        <p>The training section contains a pretty awesome interactive manual built using Turn.js. It allows users to read all about different features and uses of the intranet, all within the comfort of their browser. With animated page turning, keyboard navigation, a table of contents, and lots of images, it's a very easy-to-use and rewarding resource.</p>
