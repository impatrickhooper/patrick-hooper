description: The resources section of Wantman Group, Inc.'s intranet had outgrown itself and needed to be converted into a full-fledged site of its own. So, using a design and organizational structure (pretty heavily) inspired by the awesome folks at <a class="underline" href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, the WGIki was born. Its intuitive and colorful interface as well as the robust search functionality and added ability for content managers to manage their own stuff make it a delight to use <em>and</em> a treat for the eyes!

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ HOME }</h3>
        <p>The home page lists each division of WGI and its associated color in a stacked card-style format. Clicking a card will take you to the page for that division. At the bottom of the home page (and every page) is a footer containg the names of the content managers for each division.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ NAVIGATION }</h3>
        <p>The WGIki has a few navigational components. The menu icon in the top right opens the side nav with some user info as well as division links. Categories for a division appear if you're under that division's umbrella of pages. Clicking the star in the top right opens the favorites drawer with quick links. Finally, fixed in the bottom right are floating buttons that open for feedback or help forms.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ DIVISIONS }</h3>
        <p>At the top of the resource hierachy is the division. Each division within WGI has its own categories and resources that it maintains. On the main page for each division, links to all its categories are listed with a brief description. Oh, and just for a little added flare, each division also has a unique color that is used thematically throughout its pages (notice the nav bar and cards).</p>

      <div class="section_photos grid-66 pull-33 tablet-grid-100 mobile-grid-100">

      <div class="section_description grid-33 tablet-grid-100 mobile-grid-100">
        <h3 class="subtitle">{ CATEGORIES }</h3>
        <p>Next up in the hierachy are categories. Individual resources are assigned categories, and the main page for each category lists all the resources that make it up. A short description is provided to help give users an idea of what they'll find here. Resources are presented in a tab-like list with icons and other useful information to let users know what they're in for. Hovering over a resource makes it scale up (slightly).</p>

      <div class="section_photos grid-66 tablet-grid-100 mobile-grid-100">

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ RESOURCES }</h3>
        <p>Finally, at the bottom of the hierachy are individual resources. These can come in a variety of formats (single files, multiple files, external links, self-composed articles, etc.), and an edit button is available to content managers for quick access to the backend of a page.</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ SEARCH }</h3>
        <p>The search functionality of the WGIki scours all resources and returns a list of the most relevant ones (using <a class="underline" href="http://www.relevanssi.com/" target="_blank">Relevanssi</a>. The results are listed just like resources on a category page, with a little additional information about where to find them specifically.</p>
