description: MSi had grown tired of their antique site and wanted to be vaulted into the modern era. Ask and ye shall receive! Elements such as a predominantly single-page layout, full-width slider, subtle animations, AJAX loading, and more were used to help usher them into the year 2015, all the while maintaining a focus on usability and a clutter-free design.

        <h3 class="subtitle">{ SALES KIT }</h3>
        <p>MSi also has a wealth of additional information about each product and many other resources like presentations and rebate information that clients find useful. The trick with all this information on a website was organizing it in a way that is intutive and simple. The answer? Google Images-style drawers and accordions inside of those to hide and reveal information as necessary!</p>
