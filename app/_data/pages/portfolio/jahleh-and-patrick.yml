  - subtitle: 'Our Story'
    description: "We really wanted to emphasize how we got here and how much fun we've had along the way in a creative, visual way. So we pulled together a bunch of our favorite pictures to help us out, wrote some (clever?) taglines, and played connect the dots."

  - subtitle: 'RSVP'
    description: 'Each invitation sent out had a personalized code attached. The invitee could then enter this code in the RSVP form to bring up their name and the name of their +1, where applicable. To finalize their RSVP, it was as simple as checking the box if they were attending and then clicking submit. Easy breezy.'
