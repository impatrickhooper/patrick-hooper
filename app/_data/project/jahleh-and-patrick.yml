  - subtitle: RSVP
    description: "Each invitation sent out had a personalized code attached. The invitee could then enter this code in the RSVP form to bring up their name and the name of their +1, where applicable. To finalize their RSVP, it was as simple as checking the box if they were attending and then clicking submit. Easy breezy."
