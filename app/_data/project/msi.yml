# Overview
project_overview:
  teaser: "A super trendy revamp of MSi's marketing website."
  description: "MSi had grown tired of their antique site and wanted to be vaulted into the now. Well, they got what they asked for! As one of my earlier efforts with WordPress, a premium theme was used to provide elements such as a predominantly single-page layout, full-width slider, subtle animations, AJAX loading, and more. These pieces, plus some custom code and polish, helped usher them into the year 2015, all the while maintaining a focus on usability and a clutter-free design."

  - subtitle: Sales Kit
    description: "MSi also has a wealth of additional information about each product and many other resources like presentations and rebate information that clients find useful. The trick with all this information on a website was organizing it in a way that is intutive and simple. The answer? Custom-made Google Image-style drawers and accordions inside of those to hide and reveal information as necessary!"
