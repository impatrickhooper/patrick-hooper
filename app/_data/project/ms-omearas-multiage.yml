# Overview
project_overview:
  teaser: "The original, whimsical website for the classroom of Ms. O'Meara (my mom), her students, and their parents."
  description: 'My mom teaches a multiage (1st, 2nd, 3rd grade) classroom and was looking for a better way to share resources, photos, information, and more with parents and students. <a class="underline" href="https://mariehooper.me" target="_blank">Marie</a> and I helped her out by creating a website that caters to both kids and adults in a fun and natural way. While our original WordPress iteration of her classroom site has been retired, you can still visit a working, static version of it using the button below!'

  - subtitle: Kids
    description: "The kids section was designed to be fun and easy to use for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd graders. The default kids page presents them with big, colorful buttons for each subject. Once on a subject page, students will still see that navigation to jump between subjects, and then can use the accordion menus to browse links of resources."
